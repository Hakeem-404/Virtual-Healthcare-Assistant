A virtual healthcare assistant that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret patient symptom descriptions and provide preliminary medical advice. This project is designed to assist patients in understanding their symptoms before deciding to visit a healthcare professional.
üåü Features

Symptom Analysis: Uses a fine-tuned BioBERT model to analyze patient-described symptoms
Dual Prediction: Provides both a suggested action (Go to Emergency, Take Home Care Measures, Visit Doctor) and a potential condition
Confidence Scoring: Shows prediction confidence levels for transparency
Comprehensive Input: Considers demographic factors, symptom severity, medical history, and more
User-Friendly Interface: Simple web interface designed for users of all technical abilities
Safety Mechanisms: Includes disclaimers and emergency detection features

üß† Model Details
The system uses two fine-tuned BioBERT models:

Action Prediction Model:

Base: dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1
Classes: "Go to Emergency", "Take Home Care Measures", "Visit Doctor"
Accuracy: ~92%


Condition Prediction Model:

Base: dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1
18 Classes including: Allergic Reaction, Anxiety, Arthritis, Asthma, Common Cold, Covid-19, Dehydration, Diabetes, Flu, Food Poisoning, Gastroenteritis, Hypertension, Kidney Stones, Migraine, Muscle Strain, None, Sciatica, Sinus Infection
Accuracy: ~85%



üöÄ Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
PyTorch
Flask
Transformers library

Setup

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/Hakeem-404/Virtual-Healthcare-Assistant.git
cd irtual-Healthcare-Assistant

Install dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Download the fine-tuned models or train your own:

If using pre-trained models, unzip them to the appropriate directories
If training your own, see the Training section below


Run the application:
bashpython app.py

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:5000


üîß Training Your Own Models
We trained our models on a dataset of 3,600 medical records, including:

1,500 records from the primary dataset (data.csv)
2,100 additional records from synthetic datasets (synthetic.csv, synthetic1.csv, synthetic2.csv)

To train your own models:

Prepare your dataset with the following fields:

Demographics: Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Region, Socioeconomic Status
Medical information: Symptom Description, Symptom Severity, Duration, Additional Symptoms
Medical history: Chronic Condition, Allergies, Previous Visits, Insurance Status
Target variables: Potential Condition, Suggested Action


Run the training script:
bashpython train_models.py


The training process uses the following parameters:

Learning rate: 2e-5
Batch size: 4
Epochs: 5
Max sequence length: 128 tokens
