This ADV 1 folder contains the NLP model and the local web application code.
The Training/NLP model is in the training folder.
The web application needs the app.py file to be run before a local web server URL will be generated.
P.S. You might encounter an issue running the training model because my system uses GPU, and the code has been tuned to work on GPU.
